This projects continues [MacroKeyB](https://github.com/spinalcord/MacroKeyB) which was written in rust.
MacroTinyKeyB is a Linux-exclusive tool (currently) that transforms any secondary keyboard into a powerful macro controller. By intercepting and blocking input from a secondary keyboard, MacroTinyKeyB allows you to assign custom Lua scripts to each key, creating a dedicated macro pad for productivity, gaming, or creative workflows.

# Simple
In a Nutshell
- Grabb the second Keyboard
- Press a Key for instance "s"
- Open the Scripts folder (your macro key is created automatically "s.lua")
- Write lua code in it
- Fire you macro
